# Team-9-Seasonal Eats

# Seasonal Eats
A website that recommends recipes based on the current weather in your area.

## Description
This web-site was made with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Tailwind.
It allows a user to enter their zip-code, which then generates a list of recipes that would be enjoyable for the current weather conditions.

## Usage
1. Navigate to:  https://sora0216.github.io/SeasonalEats/
2. Enter you zipcode into the modal and press the apply button. 
3. The modal will disappear and the user will see their current weather displayed on the weather dashboard.
4. The user will also see a gallary of recipe images displayed below that are appropriate for their current weather conditions.
5. If a dish looks appealing, the user can hover their mouse over their preferred recipe image, to be shown the recipe card with a list of ingredients and directions for preparing the recipe.
6. The user can also choose to enter a new zipcode in the search box, which will display new recipes (if the weather is markedly different in the new location).
